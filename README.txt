This repository is for my Software Engineering module assignment.

It contains a libgdx game for an endless runner game called CocoRun.

In this game you play as a coconut that fell off a tree into the road.

But in a twist of events, the coconut grew a pair of legs! So now it's
running instead of rolling down the road.
